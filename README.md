# Project Title

CIS 3300 Example Code

## Description

Example code for learning purposes in CIS 3300.

The purpose of these projects is to learn Java code and programming concepts. It is not considered perfect or tested code, and is not meant to be the best or most efficient way of doing something (in fact, I know it is not in most cases). It should not be used in production environments, and should not be criticized without knowing the full context of the lessons.

Java JDK 24, Eclipse IDE, (more coming soon...)
