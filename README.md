# Project Title

CIS 3300 Example Code

## Description

Example code for learning purposes in CIS 3300.

These projects aim to teach the fundamentals of Java programming and coding skills. They are not polished or fully tested and are not meant to be the most optimal or efficient solutions (I acknowledge they often are not). They should not be employed in production settings or judged without considering the complete context.
